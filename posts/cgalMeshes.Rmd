My new package [cgalMeshes](https://github.com/stla/cgalMeshes) (not on CRAN 
yet) deals with 3D meshes. All algorithms implemented in this package are 
performed by the C++ library [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/).

I already wrapped some **CGAL** stuff in some other packages. But these 
packages have been archived by CRAN because there were some warnings from 
the **CGAL** library, and I can't fix them. So I didn't implement the 
algorithms which throw some CRAN-unacceptable warnings in **cgalMeshes**, and 
hopefully this package will remain on CRAN.

Moreover this package is different: the meshes are represented by a **R6** 
class, called `cgalMesh`. This is more convenient for the user, and once a 
mesh is instantiated, it stays in memory, whereas the mesh was reprocessed 
at each operation with the other packages.

Let's have a quick look at **cgalMeshes**. Recall that the **R6** class 
representing a mesh is called `cgalMesh`. So to create a **R6** object from 
this class, one has to use the `new` method. This method allows to instantiate 
a mesh from a file, a **rgl** mesh, or from a matrix of vertices and a list of 
faces.

I have the Stanford dragon in a mesh file. Let's create a new `cgalMesh` 
object from this file:

```{r}
library(cgalMeshes)
dragon <- cgalMesh$new("StanfordDragon.off")
dragon
```

Let's plot it. We first do a **rgl** mesh from `dragon` with the `getMesh` 
method:

```{r}
rglDragon <- dragon$getMesh()
```

And now we plot the Stanford dragon:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rgl)
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
view3d(-30, 0, zoom = 0.7)
shade3d(rglDragon, color = "darkgreen")
```

We can check whether the mesh is triangle and closed:

```{r}
dragon$isTriangle()
dragon$isClosed()
```

I don't know why this mesh is not closed. If it were closed, we could get its 
volume by running `dragon$volume`:

```{r, error=TRUE}
dragon$volume()
```

Let's do something more funny now. We will compute the geodesic distances 
between a source vertex on the mesh and all other vertices, and we will plot 
the dragon after assigning to each vertex a color corresponding to its geodesic 
distance from the source vertex. The geodesic distance between two vertices is 
the length of the shortest path between these two vertices which lies on the 
surface of the mesh.

We will take the rightmost vertex for the source vertex:

```{r}
vertices <- dragon$vertices()
index <- which.max(vertices[, 1L])
```

And we call the `geoDists` method to get the estimated geodesic distances:

```{r}
geoDists <- dragon$geoDists(index)
```

Now we define a coloring function, which associates a color of the 
`viridisLite::plasma` palette to each number in $(0, 1)$:

```{r}
fcolor <- colorRamp(viridisLite::plasma(200L))
```

Then we associate a color to each vertex:

```{r}
colors <- fcolor(geoDists / max(geoDists))
```

The `colors` object is a matrix, one row for each vertex, and the columns 
provide the RGB coding of the color. We use the `rgb` function to get 
hexadecimal colors:

```{r}
colors <- rgb(
  colors[, 1L], colors[, 2L], colors[, 3L], maxColorValue = 255
)
```

Now we can add these colors to the **rgl** mesh:

```{r}
rglDragon[["material"]] <- list("color" = colors)
```

And here is the result:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
view3d(-30, 0, zoom = 0.7)
shade3d(rglDragon)
```
