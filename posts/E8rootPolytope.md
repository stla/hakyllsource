title: The E8 root polytope
---

The E8 root polytope, its vertices and its edges
------------------------------------------------

The *E8 root polytope*, also known as the [$4_{21}$
polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_21_polytope) is a
8-dimensional polytope. The Cartesian coordinates of its vertices are
described in the above linked Wikipedia page. It has 240 vertices, that
can be separated in two sets. The first set is obtained from
$(\pm 2, \pm 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ by taking an arbitrary combination of
the signs and an arbitrary permutation of the coordinates. This gives
$2^2 \tbinom{8}{2} = 112$ vertices, that one can obtain as follows in R:

``` {.r}
combs <- arrangements::combinations(8L, 2L)
vertices1 <- NULL
for(i in 1L:nrow(combs)){
  comb <- combs[i, ]
  for(x in c(-2, 2)){
    for(y in c(-2, 2)){
      zeros <- rep(0, 8L)
      zeros[comb[1L]] <- x
      zeros[comb[2L]] <- y
      vertices1 <- rbind(vertices1, zeros)
    }
  }
}
```

Indeed we get $112$ vertices, in a matrix with stupid row names:

``` {.r}
str(vertices1)
##  num [1:112, 1:8] -2 -2 2 2 -2 -2 2 2 -2 -2 ...
##  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   ..$ : chr [1:112] "zeros" "zeros" "zeros" "zeros" ...
##   ..$ : NULL
head(vertices1)
##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]
## zeros   -2   -2    0    0    0    0    0    0
## zeros   -2    2    0    0    0    0    0    0
## zeros    2   -2    0    0    0    0    0    0
## zeros    2    2    0    0    0    0    0    0
## zeros   -2    0   -2    0    0    0    0    0
## zeros   -2    0    2    0    0    0    0    0
```

The second set of vertices is obtained from $(\pm 1, \ldots, \pm 1)$ by
taking an even number of minus signs. As noted in the Wikipedia article,
this amounts to say that the sum of the coordinates is a multiple of
$4$.

``` {.r}
vertices2 <- NULL
grd <- as.matrix(expand.grid(rep(list(c(-1, 1)), 8L)))
for(i in 1L:nrow(grd)){
  v <- grd[i, ]
  if(sum(v) %% 4 == 0){
    vertices2 <- rbind(vertices2, v)
  }
}
```

This gives $128$ vertices, again in a matrix with stupid row names:

``` {.r}
str(vertices2)
##  num [1:128, 1:8] -1 1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 ...
##  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   ..$ : chr [1:128] "v" "v" "v" "v" ...
##   ..$ : chr [1:8] "Var1" "Var2" "Var3" "Var4" ...
head(vertices2)
##   Var1 Var2 Var3 Var4 Var5 Var6 Var7 Var8
## v   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1
## v    1    1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1
## v    1   -1    1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1
## v   -1    1    1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1
## v    1   -1   -1    1   -1   -1   -1   -1
## v   -1    1   -1    1   -1   -1   -1   -1
```

So here is our matrix of $240$ vertices:

``` {.r}
vertices <- rbind(vertices1, vertices2)
```

Well. Now, how to get the *edges* of the polytope? An edge is a pair of
connected (adjacent) vertices, and it is better to store them as pairs
of vertex indices (the row indices of our `vertices` matrix).

My first attempt was to resort to my package **cxhull**. Indeed, the E8
root polytope is convex, therefore its convex hull is itself, and the
`cxhull` function of the **cxhull** package provides the edges of the
convex hull. Therefore, I ran:

``` {.r}
library(cxhull)
hull <- cxhull(vertices, triangulate = FALSE)
```

What a disaster! ***Do not run this code!*** It totally crashed my
laptop. Perhaps that can work with more RAM, I don't know (I have only 8
Gb). I searched and I searched on the web, with no luck, I didn't find
these edges. So I decided to search another computational geometry
library, able to get these edges. I thought of the C library
[cddlib](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/fukudak/cdd_home/). I'm not a star
in C but this library is wrapped in the Julia library
[CDDLib.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPolyhedra/CDDLib.jl). No luck: this
wrapper is incomplete and the vertex adjacency was not available in this
library. Then I opened an issue on the Github repo to request this
feature, and I looked at the documentation of the Python wrapper of
**cddlib**: the **pycddlib** library. Very nice: it provides the vertex
adjacency feature. I didn't have the courage to program the construction
of the vertices in Python, so I used [my old blog
post](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/Rmatrix2HaskellList.html),
*"A R matrix to a Haskell list"*, since it is also usable for Python
instead of Haskell. But now let's show how to construct the vertices in
Python:

``` {.python}
from itertools import product, combinations
import numpy as np

vertices = []

# our `vertices1` in R:
for i, j in combinations(range(8), 2):
    for x, y in product([-2, 2], repeat = 2):
        v = np.zeros(8)
        v[i] = x
        v[j] = y
        vertices.append(v)

# our `vertices2` in R:
for v in product([-1, 1], repeat = 8):
    if sum(v) % 4 == 0:
        vertices.append(v)
```

Actually I'm not the author of this code (I will come back to this point
later). I have a long experience with R and a short experience with
Python, so for me the construction of the vertices is easier in R. But I
have to be honest: the Python code is more elegant.

Now, the edges. In fact **pycddlib** is simply called **cdd** in Python:

``` {.python}
import cdd as pcdd
```

We want to do the so-called V-representation of the polytope
(representation by the vertices), and then (I refer you to the
documentation for this point), we have to prepend a $1$ to each vertex
coordinates:

``` {.python}
vertices = np.hstack((np.ones((240, 1)), vertices))
```

Now we're ready for using **pycddlib**. Here is how I proceeded. I used
the `get_input_adjacency` method to get the list of adjacent vertices
for each vertex and from this list I constructed a two-columns matrix
`Edges` to store the edges as pairs of vertex indices:

``` {.python}
# make the polytope
mat = pcdd.Matrix(vertices, linear = False, number_type = "fraction") 
mat.rep_type = pcdd.RepType.GENERATOR
poly = pcdd.Polyhedron(mat)
# get the list of adjacencies
adjacencies = [list(x) for x in poly.get_input_adjacency()]
# construct the matrix of edges
edges = [None]*240
for i, indices in enumerate(adjacencies):
    indices = list(filter(lambda x: x>i, indices))
    l = len(indices)
    col1 = np.full((l, 1), i)
    indices = np.reshape(indices, (l, 1))
    edges[i] = np.hstack((col1, indices))
Edges = np.vstack(tuple(edges))
np.savetxt("E8_edges.csv", Edges, fmt = "%d", delimiter = ",")
```

I saved the edges matrix in a **csv** file to import it in R (don't
forget to add $1$ to the indices if you do that).

In the meantime, the author of the Julia library **CDDLib.jl** kindly
replied to my feature request, and now the vertex adjacencies are
available in this library.

Projection on the Coxeter plane
-------------------------------

That's fine to have the vertices and the edges of a 8-dimensional
polytope but it remains to project it in 2D or 3D if we want to
visualize something. The most known figure of a projection of the E8
root polytope is the one of its projection to the so-called Coxeter
plane. No luck, I didn't find on the web how to do this projection. I
found another one,
[here](https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2016/03/16/e8-in-e6-petrie-projection/).
The author of this article provides an orthonormal basis of a plane in
the 8D space, and when one takes the two coordinates of the projections
of the vertices on this plane, one gets this figure:

![](figures/E8_Petrie.png)

Not bad. Of course I did a GIF:

![](figures/E8_Petrie.gif)

Finally, I found the orthonormal basis of the Coxeter plane in a [Python
script on
Github](https://github.com/SuperJason/python/blob/96989d1681085a87a0d7f488d926a1677cd7041f/famous_math_graphics/e8.py).

Do you recognize the beginning of the code? The author of this script is
also the author of the Python code I provided earlier. I was astonished:
he doesn't use any computational geometry library to get the edges! I
don't know why, but two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if
the squared distance between these vertices is $8$. So you get the edges
like this in R:

``` {.r}
edges <- NULL
for(i in 1L:(nrow(vertices)-1L)){
  v1 <- vertices[i, ]
  for(j in (i+1L):nrow(vertices)){
    v2 <- vertices[j, ]
    if(c(crossprod(v1-v2)) == 8){
      edges <- rbind(edges, c(i, j))
    }
  }
}
```

Also, I don't understand the derivation of the basis of the Coxeter
plane that is provided by this Python script. But it is easy to
translate it in R. Here is the code, where I kept the comments of the
Python script:

``` {.r}
# A set of simple roots, listed by the rows of 'delta'
delta <- rbind(
  c(1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
  c(0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
  c(0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0),
  c(-.5, -.5, -.5, -.5, -.5, -.5, -.5, -.5),
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0)
)

# Dynkin diagram of E8:
# 1---2---3---4---5---6---7
#                 |
#                 8
# where vertex i is the i-th simple root.

# The Cartan matrix:
Cartan <- tcrossprod(delta)

# Now we split the simple roots into two disjoint sets I and J
# such that the simple roots in each set are pairwise orthogonal.
# It's obvious to see how to find such a partition given the
# Dynkin graph above: I = [1, 3, 5, 7] and J = [2, 4, 6, 8],
# since roots are not connected by an edge if and only if they are orthogonal.
# Then a basis of the Coxeter plane is given by
# u1 = sum (c[i] * delta[i]) for i in I,
# u2 = sum (c[j] * delta[j]) for j in J,
# where c is an eigenvector for the minimal
# eigenvalue of the Cartan matrix.
eig <- eigen(Cartan)

# The eigenvalues returned by eigen() are in descending order
# and the eigenvectors are listed by columns.
ev <- eig$vectors[, 8L]
u1 <- rowSums(vapply(c(1L, 3L, 5L, 7L), function(i){
  ev[i] * delta[i, ]
}, numeric(8L)))
u2 <- rowSums(vapply(c(2L, 4L, 6L, 8L), function(i){
  ev[i] * delta[i, ]
}, numeric(8L)))

# Gram-Schmidt u1, u2 
u1 <- u1 / sqrt(c(crossprod(u1)))
u2 <- u2 - c(crossprod(u1, u2)) * u1
u2 <- u2 / sqrt(c(crossprod(u2)))
```

I understand nothing, except the Gram-Schmidt step.

But this works. Let's project the vertices to the Coxeter plane,
i.e.¬†the plane with the orthonormal basis $(u_1, u_2)$:

``` {.r}
# projections on the Coxeter plane
proj <- function(v){
  c(c(crossprod(v, u1)), c(crossprod(v, u2)))
}
points <- t(apply(vertices/2, 1L, proj))
```

Now you can represent these 2D points and connect them with the edges.
But if you do that with an ordinary base R plot, you will not get a
pretty figure, because there are too many edges. So I do a SVG plot:

``` {.r}
# save plot as SVG
svg(filename = "E8_Coxeter.svg", onefile = TRUE)
opar <- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(
  points[!duplicated(points), ], pch = 19, cex = 0.3, asp = 1, 
  axes = FALSE, xlab = NA, ylab = NA
)
for(i in 1L:nrow(edges)){
  lines(points[edges[i, ], ], lwd = 0.1)
}
par(opar)
dev.off()
```

And then I convert it to a PNG image with the help of the **rsvg**
package:

``` {.r}
rsvg::rsvg_png("E8_Coxeter.svg", file = "E8_Coxeter.png")
```

This gives this image:

![](figures/E8_Coxeter.png)

Rather pretty. But this lacks of colors. And of motion. Well, you see
what I mean: I did a GIF.
