I started to do a [youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ2hC8ETS9FFm2pzzyZCVUw/videos)
to store my animations. In order to loop an animation, you have to
right-click on the video. I convert my GIFs to `mov` files with the R
package **av**, which works thanks to **ffmpeg**. For each video you can
find the link to the code in the description. Don't forget to subscribe
