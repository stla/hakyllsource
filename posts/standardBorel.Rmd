One can find two definitions of a *standard Borel space* in the literature: 
a measurable space is said to be a standard Borel space if *1)* it is 
isomorphic to the Borel space of a Polish space or if *2)* it is isomorphic 
to a Borel subset of a Polish space. 
We present a proof of the equivalence between these two definitions.


Let $E$ be a Polish space. A set $A \subset E$ is said to be *analytic* if 
there exist a Polish space $Z$ and a continuous function $f \colon Z \to E$ 
such that $f(Z) = A$.

**Lemma.** *Let $E$ be a Polish space. Then every open subset of $E$ 
is analytic.*

*Proof.* 
[An open subset of a Polish space is Polish](./conditionalLaw.html). 
Therefore the lemma follows from the continuity of the canonical injection 
of a subspace of $E$ into $E$.
&square;


**Proposition.** *Let $E$ be a Polish space, and let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be 
analytic subsets of $E$. Then $\bigcup_k A_k$ and $\bigcap_k A_k$ are 
analytic.*

*Proof.* For each $k$ choose a Polish space $Z_k$ and a continous function 
$f_k \colon Z_k \to E$ such that $f_k(Z_k) = A_k$. Let $Z$ be the 
[disjoint union](./Lusin.html) of the $Z_k$. Define $f \colon Z \to E$ by 
$f\bigl((x,k)\bigr) = f_k(x)$. Then $f$ is continuous and 
$f(Z) = \bigcup_k A_k$. Since $Z$ is Polish, $\bigcup_k A_k$ is analytic. 
Now take the product space $\prod_k Z_k$ and let $Z$ be its subspace consisting 
of sequences $(z_k)$ such that $f_i(z_i) = f_j(z_j)$ holds for all $i$ and $j$. 
Then $\bigcap_k A_k$ is the image of $Z$ under the continuous function that 
sends $(z_k)$ to $f_1(z_1)$, hence $\bigcap_k A_k$ is analytic since 
$Z$ is Polish. 
&square;


**Proposition.** *Every Borel subset of a Polish space is analytic.*

*Proof.* We have just seen that the collection of analytic subsets of $E$ 
contains the open sets and is closed under countable intersection and 
countable union. 
[Therefore it contains the Borel subsets](./Lusin.html). 
&square;


We denote by $\mathcal{B}_E$ the Borel $\sigma$-field of a 
topological space $E$.

An *analytic measurable space* is a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ such 
that there exist a Polish space $Z$ and an analytic subset $A$ of $Z$ such 
that $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is Borel-isomorphic to $(A,\mathcal{B}_A)$. 
By the above proposition, a Borel subset of a Polish space equipped with its 
Borel $\sigma$-algebra is an analytic measurable space. 


**Theorem.** *A bijective measurable map between analytic measurable spaces 
is a Borel isomorphism.*

*Proof.* See [1]. &square;


A *standard Borel space* is a measurable space isomorphic to the Borel space 
of a Polish space. 


**Theorem.** *A measurable space is a standard Borel space if and only if 
it is isomorphic to a Borel subset of a Polish space.*

*Proof.* The "only if" part is obvious. Now assume that the measurable 
space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is isomorphic to the Borel space 
$(B,\mathcal{B}_B)$ of a Borel subset $B$ of a Polish space $E$. 
By the key proposition of 
[Lusin spaces are strongly Lindelöf](./Lusin.html), 
there exist a Polish space $Z$ and a continuous bijection $f$ from 
$Z$ onto $B$. The measurable spaces $(Z,\mathcal{B}_Z)$ and 
$(B,\mathcal{B}_B)$ are analytic measurable spaces. 
By the above theorem, $f$ is a Borel isomorphism. 
Thus $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is isomorphic to $(Z,\mathcal{B}_Z)$. 
&square;


**Corollary.** *The Borel space of a [Lusin space](./Lusin.html) is 
standard Borel.*

*Proof.* A compact metric space is Polish, and a homeomorphism is 
a Borel isomorphism. 
&square;


Let us mention another result, proved in [2]: the Borel space of 
a separable metric space $E$ is standard Borel if and only if $E$ is 
*homeomorphic* to a Borel subset of a Polish space.
