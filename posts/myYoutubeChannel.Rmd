I started to do a 
[youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ2hC8ETS9FFm2pzzyZCVUw/videos) 
to store my animations. In order to loop an animation, you have to right-click 
on the video. I convert my GIFs to `mov` files with the R package **av**, which 
works thanks to **ffmpeg**. For each video you can find the link to the code in 
the description. Don't forget to subscribe :-)
