Given a complex number $z_c$, called *the Julia point*, the
corresponding *Julia fractal* is obtained by iterating
$z \mapsto z^2 + z_c$ for each complex number $z$ until the modulus of
$z$ exceeds a certain threshold or the maximal number of iterations is
attained. Then a color is assigned to $z$.

An *orbit trapped Julia fractal* is obtained in the same way, but the
iteration is stopped whenever $z$ is close enough to a given set such as
a square or a circle. In the example shown below, we take the two axes
as this trapping set.

I also add something: instead of looking at the distance between $z$ and
the two axes, I look at the distance between $z$ and the axes after
having rotated $z$ by an angle $\alpha$. Then I'll vary $\alpha$ to get
an animation.

So here is the code of this algorithm; the color assigned to the final
$z$ is defined in function of the value of the trapping function (the
distance):

``` r
# trapping function:
#   distance (up to factor 1/0.03) between alpha-rotated z and axes
f <- function(z, alpha) {
  z <- z * exp(1i*alpha)
  min(abs(Re(z)), abs(Im(z))) / 0.03
}

# choose the Julia point
juliaPoint <- complex(real = -0.687, imaginary = 0.299015)

# main function
Julia <- Vectorize(function(x, y, juliaPoint, alpha) {
  # counter
  i <- 0L
  # current point, to be iterated
  z <- complex(real = x, imaginary = y)
  # iterations
  while(i < 100L && Mod(z) < 100 && (i < 2L || f(z, alpha) > 1)) {
    z <- z^2 + juliaPoint
    i <- i + 1L
  }
  # now assign a color to the resulting z
  fz <- 2 * f(z, alpha)
  hsv( # h, s, v must be in (0, 1)
    h = (Arg(z) + pi) / (2 * pi), 
    s = min(1, fz), 
    v = max(0, min(1, 2 - fz))
  )
})
```

The condition `i < 2L` ensures that the iteration is not stopped at the
beginning. Let's plot a first image:

``` r
# run the orbit trapping of Julia
n <- 2048L
x_ <- seq(-2,   2,   length.out = n)
y_ <- seq(-1.5, 1.5, length.out = n)
img <- t(outer(x_, y_, Julia, juliaPoint = juliaPoint, alpha = 0))
# plot
opar <- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "black")
plot(c(-100, 100), c(-100, 100), type = "n", asp = 3/4, 
     xlab = NA, ylab = NA, axes = FALSE, xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i")
rasterImage(img, -100, -100, 100, 100)
par(opar)
```

And here is the animation obtained by varying the angle $\alpha$:

Such a fractal is easily and efficiently rendered as a *shader*. [Click
here](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/frames/pixijs_orbitTrap_julia.html)
to play with the shader, in which the cursor of the mouse is used to
take the Julia point. I also modified the trapping function ($z^3$
instead of $z$).
