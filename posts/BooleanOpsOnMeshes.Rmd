I'm still working on my package **RCGAL**, that I already present in 
[a previous post](./SurfaceReconstruction.html). 

This previous post was about the reconstruction of surfaces. Now I implemented 
the *Boolean operations on meshes*. Here are some simple examples.

#### Union of two cubes:

#### Intersection of two cubes (one rotated):

#### Difference of two cubes:

![](./figures/cubesDifference.png)

#### Intersection of a cube and a truncated icosahedron:

![](./figures/cubesIntersection.png)

The code generating these plots is given in the RCGAL examples. 

Now let's turn to a more interesting example.


## The compound of five tetrahedra

The compound of five tetrahedra is provided by **RCGAL**. These are five 
tetrahedra in a pretty configuration, each centered at the origin. You can 
get their meshes by typing `tetrahedraCompound`. This is a list with two 
components: a field `meshes` providing for each tetrahderon its vertices and 
its faces, and a field `rglmeshes`, similar to `meshes` but these meshes are 
ready for plotting with the **rgl** package. Here it is:

```r
library(RCGAL)
library(rgl)
rglmeshes <- tetrahedraCompound[["rglmeshes"]]
open3d(windowRect = c(50, 50, 562, 562), zoom = 0.75)
bg3d("#363940")
colors <- hcl.colors(5, palette = "Spectral")
invisible(lapply(
  1:5, function(i) shade3d(rglmeshes[[i]], color = colors[i])
))
```

I wondered for a long time what is the intersection of these five tetrahedra. 
But I didn't have any tool to compute it. Now I have. Let's see.

```r
# compute the intersection ####
inter <- MeshesIntersection(
  tetrahedraCompound[["meshes"]], numbersType = "lazyExact", clean = TRUE
)
# plot ####
open3d(windowRect = c(50, 50, 562, 562), zoom = 0.75)
bg3d("#363940")
# first the five tetrahedra with transparency ####
invisible(lapply(
  rglmeshes, shade3d, color = "yellow", alpha = 0.1
))
# now the intersection ####
rglinter <- tmesh3d(
  "vertices"    = t(inter[["vertices"]]),
  "indices"     = t(inter[["faces"]]),
  "homogeneous" = FALSE
)
shade3d(rglinter, color = "gainsboro")
# and finally the edges ####
plotEdges(
  inter[["vertices"]], inter[["exteriorEdges"]],
  only = inter[["exteriorVertices"]], color = "darkmagenta"
)
```
Here is the result:

This is an icosahedron, I think. 

Unfortunately, R CMD CHECK still throws some warnings which prevent me to 
publish this package on CRAN. I hope this issue will be solved.
