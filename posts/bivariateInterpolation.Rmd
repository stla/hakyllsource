I still wrapped a part of the C++ library **CGAL** in a R package, namely 
[**interpolation**](https://github.com/stla/interpolation).

The purpose of this package is to perform interpolation of bivariate functions. 
As compared to existing packages, it can do more: it can interpolate 
vector-valued functions (with dimension two or three), and it does not require 
that the given data are gridded. I will illustrate this second point here.

First, let's plot a surface $z = f(x, y)$.

```r
# make a square grid
x <- y <- seq(-3, 3, by = 0.1)
Grid <- expand.grid(X = x, Y = y)
# make surface 
z <- with(Grid, 30 * dcauchy(X) * dcauchy(Y))
# plot
library(deldir)
delxyz <- deldir(Grid[["X"]], Grid[["Y"]], z = z)
library(rgl)
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
persp3d(delxyz, color = "red")
```

Now we will make a hole in this surface, and then we will interpolate it.

```r
# make a hole in the grid: the square [-0.5, 1]x[-0.5, 1]
toremove <- with(Grid, X > -0.5 & X < 1 & Y > -0.5 & Y < 1)
GridWithHole <- Grid[!toremove, ]
# plot this grid
plot(GridWithHole[["X"]], GridWithHole[["Y"]], pch = 19, asp = 1)
```

![](./figures/gridWithHole.png){width=50%}

Now, to plot the surface with the hole, I will use a constrained Delaunay 
triangulation. I didn't find a more straightforward way.

```r
# constraint edges: squares [-0.5, 1]x[-0.5, 1] and [-3, 3]x[-3, 3]
Constraints <- data.frame(
  X = c(-0.5, 1, 1, -0.5, -3, 3, 3, -3),
  Y = c(-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1, -3, -3, 3, 3)
)
# add constraint edges to the grid with the hole
GridWithHole <- rbind(Constraints, GridWithHole)
# remove duplicated points
GridWithHole <- GridWithHole[!duplicated(GridWithHole), ]
# vertices
points <- cbind(GridWithHole[["X"]], GridWithHole[["Y"]])
# constraint edges must be given by vertex indices
edges <- rbind(c(1L, 2L), c(2L, 3L), c(3L, 4L), c(4L, 1L)) # the hole
edges <- rbind(edges, edges + 4L) # the outer square
# perform constrained Delaunay triangulation
library(delaunay)
del <- delaunay(points, constraints = edges)
```

Note that the **delaunay** package is also a wrapper of **CGAL**. 

This Delaunay triangulation provides triangular faces that we can use to 
create a 3D **rgl** mesh.

```r
# create surface plot
z <- with(GridWithHole, 30 * dcauchy(X) * dcauchy(Y))
vertices <- cbind(points, z)
rmesh <- tmesh3d(
  vertices = t(vertices),
  indices  = t(del[["faces"]]),
  homogeneous = FALSE
)
rmesh <- addNormals(rmesh)
# we plot the front side in red and the back side in gray
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
shade3d(rmesh, color = "red", back = "cull")
shade3d(rmesh, color = "gray", front = "cull")
persp3d(delxyz, add = TRUE, alpha = 0.2)
```

Good. Now let's interpolate.

```r
# make the interpolating function
library(interpolation)
fun <- interpfun(
  GridWithHole[["X"]], GridWithHole[["Y"]], z, method = "linear"
)
# make a grid of the hole
xnew <- ynew <- seq(-0.5, 1, by = 0.04)
griddedHole <- expand.grid(X = xnew, Y = ynew)
# interpolation
znew <- fun(griddedHole[["X"]], griddedHole[["Y"]])
# new 3D data
newPoints <- cbind(griddedHole[["X"]], griddedHole[["Y"]], znew)
# plot
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
shade3d(rmesh, color = "red", back = "cull")
shade3d(rmesh, color = "gray", front = "cull")
points3d(newPoints)
```

Not very nice, you think? Right, but I used the linear method of interpolation 
here. The **interpolation** package also provides the *Sibson* method, this 
one is not linear. One just has to repeat the above code but starting with:

```r
fun <- interpfun(
  GridWithHole[["X"]], GridWithHole[["Y"]], z, method = "sibson"
)
```

And we obtain:

This is not exactly the true curve, but nevertheless this is impressive.
