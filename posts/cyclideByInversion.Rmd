An [elliptic Dupin cyclide](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/torusAndCyclide.html) 
can be obtained by 
[inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversive_geometry) of a torus with 
respect to a sphere. In the
[previous post](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/torusAndCyclide.html), 
I showed a rotoid (an helix) dancing around a cyclide:

I constructed this dancing rotoid in the same way as the dancing rotoid 
around a torus:

if you want the POV-Ray code for this animation.

Now, what happens if one inverts these two geometrical objects, the torus and 
the rotoid, with respect to a sphere? The torus will become a cyclide, as 
previously said, and what will happen for the rotoid? Here is the answer:

The R code for this animation is provided in 
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/836d149189db9cea3d683868c1520776) 
(if it looks complicated, that's because I start with the cyclide, and I 
derive the torus and the inversion which yield this cyclide).

Another nice application of this mathematical fact is the construction of 
*Steiner chains*:

(code available in this 
[gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/e93995905bb70c54c6bd49acfa9eb635)).

The point $I$ is the center of the circle of inversion. 
The above animation shows a 2D Steiner chain but we can do the same in 3D. 
When there are six spheres, this is called a *Soddy hexlet*. 
Here is a Soddy hexlet with the *Villarceau circles* of the cyclide:

The R code which produces this animation is provided in 
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/1665769586127f95547cd32a969d1352).

I did the same picture with POV-Ray:

Go to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/4a1816abb5de4a5f1c121869a5ec0aaa) 
if you want the code.

And maybe you remember
[this previous post](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/SteinerChains.html),
where I show how one can construct *nested* 3D Steiner chains.
