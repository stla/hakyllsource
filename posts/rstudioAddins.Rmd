In this blog post I introduce three small **RStudio** addins I did.


## 'bracketify'

I prefer subsetting with the double brackets than with the dollar in R, because 
this is more readable in **RStudio** thanks to the syntax highlighting. 
That's why I did [bracketify](https://github.com/stla/bracketify). This addin 
replaces all occurrences of `foo$bar` with `foo[["bar"]]`, either in a whole 
file or only in the current selection.

To use carefully: if you have some dollar symbols in your code which are not 
used for subsetting (e.g. in a regular expression), they can be transformed by 
**bracketify**.


## 'pasteAsComment'

Originally, I made [pasteAsComment](https://github.com/stla/pasteAsComment) to 
paste the content of the clipboard as a comment:

I updated this package today. Now it also allows to paste the content of the 
clipboard as **roxygen** lines. This is particularly useful to write some code 
in the `@examples` field:

## 'JSconsole'

[JSconsole](https://github.com/stla/JSconsole) is available on CRAN. This addin 
allows to send some selected JavaScript code to the V8 console. This is useful 
when you want to test a function.
