Our goal is to prove that a Lusin space is strongly Lindelöf. 
We will need the elementary corollary below to prove the key proposition.

**Lemma.** *Let $E$ be a set and $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathrm{Pow}(E)$. 
Then the $\sigma$-field $\sigma(\mathcal{E})$ is the smallest collection 
of subsets $E$ containing $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{E}$, 
$\{E\setminus A \mid A \in \mathcal{E}\}$ and closed under countable 
intersections and countable disjoint unions.* 

*Proof.* Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the smallest collection 
of subsets $E$ containing $\varnothing$, $\mathcal{E}$, 
$\{E\setminus A \mid A \in \mathcal{E}\}$ and closed under countable 
intersections and countable disjoint unions. 
Let $\mathcal{R}' = \{A \in \mathcal{R} \mid E \setminus A \in \mathcal{R}\}$. 
Then $\mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{R}'$, and $\mathcal{R}'$ is closed under 
complements. So it is enough to show that $\mathcal{R}'$ is closed under 
countable unions. But 
$\bigcup_n A_n = \bigcup_n (A_n \setminus \bigcup_{i<n}A_i)$, so it is 
sufficient to show that $\mathcal{R}'$ is closed under finite unions. 
Let $A,B \in \mathcal{R}'$. One has 
$A \cup B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \cup (A \cap B)$ and this is 
a disjoint union, so $A \cup B \in \mathcal{R}$. Moreover 
$E \setminus (A \cup B) = (E \setminus A) \cap (E \setminus B) \in \mathcal{R}$, 
hence $A \cup B \in \mathcal{R}'$.
&square;

**Proposition.** *Let $E$ be a topological space. A class of Borel 
sets of $E$ is equal to the Borel $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{B}_E$ 
whenever it contains all open sets and 
closed sets and it is closed under countable intersections and 
countable disjoint unions.*

*Proof.* Let $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{B}_E$ be such a class. 
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the collection of open sets of $E$, so that 
$\mathcal{B}_E = \sigma(\mathcal{E})$. 
Obviously one has $\varnothing \in \mathcal{C}$. Moreover, $\mathcal{C}$ 
contains $\mathcal{E}$ and $\{E\setminus A \mid A \in \mathcal{E}\}$. 
Therefore, by the lemma above, $\mathcal{C}$ contains $\sigma(\mathcal{E})$.
&square;


**Corollary.** *Let $E$ be a metric space. A class of subsets 
of $E$ contains $\mathcal{B}_E$ whenever it contains all open sets and 
it is closed under countable intersections and disjoint countable unions.*

*Proof.* A closed set in a metric space is the countable intersection of 
some open sets. Therefore, if $\mathcal{C}\subset\mathcal{B}_E$ contains 
all open sets and is closed under countable intersections, it contains all 
closed sets. Thus the result is a consequence of the previous proposition. 
&square;


**Disjoint union topology.** We will resort to the disjoint union in the proof 
of the key proposition below. Let ${\{X_i\}}_{i \in I}$ be a collection of sets. 
The *disjoint union* of the $X_i$ is the set
$$
\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i = \bigl\{(x,i) \mid i \in I, x \in X_i\bigr\}. 
$$
Define the canonical injections 
$\varphi_i \colon X_i \to \bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i$ by 
$\varphi_i(x) = (x,i)$. When the $X_i$ are topological spaces, the 
*disjoint union topology* on $\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i$ is the finest topology 
on $\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i$ for which the canonical injections are continuous. 
In other words, this is the final topology with respect to 
${\{\varphi_i\}}_{i \in I}$. 
This topology is, denoting by $\tau_i$ the topology on $X_i$, 
$$
\tau = \bigl\{ U \in \mathrm{Pow}(X) \mid \forall i \in I, 
\varphi_i^{-1}(U) \in \tau_i\bigr\}.
$$
If $I$ is countable and the $X_i$ are second-countable, 
then $\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i$ is second-countable. 
Now assume the $X_i$ are metrizable, and for each $i \in I$ take a metric 
$d_i \leqslant 1$ on $X_i$ compatible with the topology of $X_i$. For 
$i,j \in I$, $x \in X_i$ and $y \in X_j$, define 
$$
d\bigl((x,i), (y,j)\bigr) = 
\begin{cases}
d_i(x,y) & \text{ if } i = j \\
2 & \text{ if } i \neq j
\end{cases}.
$$
It is easy to check that $d$ is a metric on $\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i$. 
Clearly, each $\varphi_i$ is $(d_i,d)$-continuous. 
If $Y$ is a topological space, and $g \colon \bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i \to Y$ is 
a map such that every $g \circ \varphi_i$ is continuous, it is easy to see 
that $g$ is continuous for $d$. Thus $d$ induces the disjoint union topology, 
by the characteristic property of the final topology. 
It is easy to see that $d$ is complete if the $d_i$ are complete. 
Since [second-countability is equivalent to separability in a metric space](./conditionalLaw.html), 
we deduce from the above that the disjoint union of a countable family of 
Polish spaces is a Polish space. 


**Key proposition.** *Let $E$ be a Polish space and $B \in \mathcal{B}_E$. 
There exist a Polish space $Z$ and a continuous bijection from 
$Z$ onto $B$.* 

*Proof.* Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of sets $B \subset E$ for which 
there exist a Polish space and a continuous bijection from $Z$ onto $B$. 
[An open subset of a Polish space is Polish](./conditionalLaw.html), 
therefore open sets of $E$ 
belong to $\mathcal{C}$. By the previous corollary, it is sufficient to show 
that $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under countable intersections and countable 
disjoint unions. 
Let $B_0$, $B_1$, $\ldots$ belong to $\mathcal{C}$. Take Polish spaces 
$Z_i$ and continuous bijections $g_i\colon Z_i \to B_i$. Define 
$$
Z = \left\{ z \in \prod_{i\geqslant 0} Z_i 
\mid g_0(z_0) = g_1(z_1) = \cdots \right\}.
$$
Then $Z$ is closed in the Polish space $\prod_{i\geqslant 0} Z_i$, 
therefore is Polish. Define $g \colon Z \to E$ by $g(z) = g_0(z_0)$. 
Then $g$ is a continuous bijection from $Z$ onto $\bigcap_{i \geqslant 0} B_i$. 
Thus $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under countable intersections. 

Now let $B_0$, $B_1$, $\ldots$ be pairwise disjoints sets belonging to 
$\mathcal{C}$. Take Polish spaces 
$Z_i$ and continuous bijections $g_i\colon Z_i \to B_i$. The 
disjoint union $Z = \bigsqcup_{i \geqslant 0}Z_i$ of the $Z_i$ is a Polish space. 
Define $g\colon Z \to E$ by $g\bigl((z,i)\bigr) = g_i(z)$. 
Then $g$ is a continuous bijection from $Z$ onto $\bigcup_{i \geqslant 0} B_i$. 
Thus $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under countable disjoint unions. 
&square;


Say that a topological space is a *Lusin space* if it is homeomorphic 
to a Borel set of a compact metric space.

**Corollary.** *If $E$ is a Lusin space, then there exist a Polish space $Z$ 
and a continuous bijection from $Z$ onto $E$.*

*Proof.* A compact metric space is Polish. Apply the previous proposition. 
&square;


To prove the proposition below, we use the results of the first 
section of [the previous post](./conditionalLaw.html).

A topological space is said to be *strongly Lindelöf* if every 
open set of this space is Lindelöf.

**Proposition.** *A Polish space is strongly Lindelöf.*

*Proof.* A Polish space is metrizable and separable, therefore it is Lindelöf. 
Since an open subset of a Polish space is Polish, we see that 
a Polish space is strongly Lindelöf. &square;


**Lemma.** *The continuous image of a strongly Lindelöf space is 
a strongly Lindelöf space.*

*Proof.* Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be two topological spaces with $E_1$ 
strongly Lindelöf, and let $f\colon E_1 \to E_2$ be a continuous function. 
Let $O_2 \subset E_2$ be an open subset of $f(E_1)$ and let 
$\mathcal{C}_2$ be an open cover of $O_2$. Then 
$\bigl\{f^{-1}(C) \mid C \in \mathcal{C}_2\bigr\}$ is an open cover of 
the open set $O_1 := f^{-1}(O_2)$. Then it has a countable subcover 
$\bigl\{f^{-1}(C) \mid C \in \mathcal{D}_2\bigr\} =: \mathcal{D}_1$ 
where $\mathcal{D}_2$ is a countable subset of $\mathcal{C}_2$. 
One has $f\bigl(f^{-1}(C)\bigr) = C$ for every $C \subset f(E_1)$, 
therefore $f(\mathcal{D}_1) = \mathcal{D}_2$ is an open subcover 
of $f(O_1) = O_2$. Thus $f(E_1)$ is strongly Lindelöf. &square;


**Theorem.** *A Lusin space is strongly Lindelöf.*

*Proof.* Let $X$ be a Lusin space, and $f \colon Y \to X$ be a surjective 
continuous function from a Polish space $Y$ onto $X$. 
By the previous proposition, $Y$ is strongly Lindelöf, therefore $X$ is 
strongly Lindelöf by the previous lemma. 
&square;
