I like the Python library **PyVista** very much. In this blog post I show a 
sample of the animations I realized with this library.

# Github repositories

[PyVistaMiscellanous](https://github.com/stla/PyVistaMiscellanous) contains 
numerous pictures and animations.

A 3-30 duoprism, realized with the method given 
[here](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/Duoprism.html).

Some [Hopf tori](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/HopfTorus2.html) 
in orbit, forming like a 
[Steiner chain](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/SteinerChains.html).

Some connected 
[linked cyclides](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/linkedCyclidesParametric.html), 
looking like a flower.

The [orbit of the modular tessellation](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/ModularTessellationOrbit.html), 
with spheres instead of circles.

A bouquet of roses. It's surprising that one can obtain such a realistic rose 
with parametric equations. 
[Here](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/frames/threejs_RosesBouquet.html) 
is an interactive **three.js** version.

The metamorphosis of a torus to a solid Möbius strip, with an electric texture.

A metamorphosis of three tori to a kind of cage. Credit to *ICN5D*, a member 
of the [Hi.gher Space forum](http://hi.gher.space/forum/).

The [PyApollony](https://github.com/stla/PyApollony) repository contains three 
Apollonian fractals.

The [PyCyclides](https://github.com/stla/PyCyclides) repository hosts a package 
to draw some linked cyclides. It contains a **PyVista** application to play 
with them:

[PyPlaneGeometry](https://github.com/stla/PyPlaneGeometry) is a Python version 
of my R package 
[PlaneGeometry](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/PlaneGeometry/vignettes/examples.html). 
I call this animation the *Malfatti-Apollonian gasket*:

And here is an elliptical nested Steiner chain:

[PySteiner](https://github.com/stla/PySteiner) is a package to draw nested 
Steiner chains. Here is one, with its enveloping cyclides:

![](https://github.com/stla/PySteiner/raw/main/examples/Steiner_3-3-5.gif)

___

[PyTorusThreePoints](https://github.com/stla/PyTorusThreePoints) is a package 
allowing to draw a torus whose equator passes through three points. Actually 
you don't need that with **PyVista**: it is easy to get a circle passing 
through three points, and with **PyVista** you can easily make it tubular.

![](https://github.com/stla/PyTorusThreePoints/raw/main/examples/VillarceauCircles.gif)

___

[PyHyperbolic3D](https://github.com/stla/PyHyperbolic3D) is a package 
allowing to draw hyperbolic triangles and tubular hyperbolic segments, with 
the help of Ungar's theory presented in 
[this post](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/hyperbolicPolyhedra.html).

![](https://github.com/stla/PyHyperbolic3D/raw/main/examples/icosahedron_colored.gif)

There's also [PyMobiusHyperbolic](https://github.com/stla/PyMobiusHyperbolic) 
which provides functions to draw hyperbolic stuff, also based on Ungar's 
theory, but it deals with the Poincaré model, whereas **PyHyperbolic3D** deals 
with the hyperboloid model. In fact these two packages are not restricted to 
3D graphics, 2D pictures are possible too, but do not involve **PyVista**:

![](https://github.com/stla/PyMobiusHyperbolic/raw/main/examples/tesselation_3-7.png)

**PyPlaneGeometry** (see above) has been used to draw this hyperbolic 
tessellation.


# Gists

I also use some gists to store my animations. Here are 
[twenty Hopf tori](https://gist.github.com/stla/7fc562f3eb1704491aff69132b7221dd):

![](https://gist.github.com/stla/7fc562f3eb1704491aff69132b7221dd/raw/a99b90810b40ff31767f0e7bdf2538e015aabad8/TwentyHopfTori.gif)

In [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/189dbed406a023189e85a328603707c8) 
you can find a rotating Hopf torus with an electric texture:

A [compound of five hyperbolic tetrahedra](https://gist.github.com/stla/7a3178906d512b7ff4e4318e41828dd8), 
made with the help of 
[Ungar's theory](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/hyperbolicPolyhedra.html):

![](https://gist.github.com/stla/7a3178906d512b7ff4e4318e41828dd8/raw/47a709984a822260f4afa0d09514fadf065d48bb/CompoundFiveHyperbolicTetrahedra.gif)

[Here](https://gist.github.com/stla/b23b18c9b936fa90c9147a27f1266c1d) there is 
an animation of some 
[slices of the tiger](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/slicedHypersurface.html):

![](https://gist.github.com/stla/b23b18c9b936fa90c9147a27f1266c1d/raw/2aae46cfa5bf30f1fd79b83e10012dbba39dbaf1/slicedTiger.gif)

In [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/f7f50025abbf6910f587fe176cc3fe00) 
there is a pretty 
[stereographic duoprism](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/DuoprismStereo.html):

![](https://gist.github.com/stla/f7f50025abbf6910f587fe176cc3fe00/raw/102dd245b1e83ce877f0848e36c5a16f5b679d1e/StereoDuoprism_3-30.gif)

[This gist](https://gist.github.com/stla/83925fce019921ec12440ad05fdcd213) 
shows an animation made from the runcinated tesseract, a 4D polytope. It is 
stereographically projected in 3D but I kept only the tetrahedrals cells, and 
it is in rotation in the 4D space.

![](https://gist.github.com/stla/83925fce019921ec12440ad05fdcd213/raw/839458ffc08d4d07ff6c4775c405fa3683866738/RTT.gif)

I hope you enjoyed the presentation.
