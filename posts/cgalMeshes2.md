I made some progress on the **cgalMeshes** package, that I introduced
[here](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/cgalMeshes.html). The
new version is not on CRAN yet.

In particular, one can know assign some properties to the meshes (the
`cgalMesh` objects). One can assign some face properties: colors and
scalars, and some vertex properties: colors, scalars, and normals.
Actually a color can be any character string, but if you really set some
colors, and you write the mesh to a file, then you'll retrieve the
colors in this file. Some of these properties are preserved by certain
operations on the mesh. For example, all properties are preserved when
one splits a mesh into connected components. This was my original
motivation by the way, more precisely I wanted to retrieve the normals
of the mesh in its connected components, because I had a mesh made with
the **rmarchingcubes** package and then it had very good normals (the
normals returned by the **rmarchingcubes** package are obtained by an
approximation of the gradient of the function defining the isosurface).
The union of two meshes preserves the face properties of the two meshes.
This is nice when one does not want to lose the colors.

Here is a couple of new features. Let's start by the new methods of the
`cgalMesh` objects. The `$clip()` method now returns two meshes: the
clipped mesh and the modified clipping mesh (it is modified by a
corefinement). These two meshes inherit the colors of the original
meshes. For example, here is the result one obtains by clipping a
cylinder to another cylinder, and then clipping the resulting mesh by a
third cylinder, with different colors for the three cylinders:

See [this page by Paul
Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/cylinders/) for more fun with
intersecting cylinders. I've tried to do something similar to the
intersection of a bunch of random cylinders but my implementation is too
time-consuming.

The `$fillBoundaryHole()` method allows to fill the holes of a mesh.
There's one option, `fair`, allowing to request a smooth hole filling or
a flat hole filling. Here is an example of a sphere with a hole, filled
with the option `fair=TRUE` and `fair=FALSE`:

Also some subdivision and deformation methods are available now. Below
is a coarse mesh of a Hopf torus and the mesh obtained after two
iterations of the Loop subdivision:

Now let's see some new functions of the package. The `algebraicMesh()`
function allows to construct a mesh of an algebraic surface, that is to
say an isosurface of the form $P(x, y, z) = 0$ where $P$ is a
polynomial. Of course it is possible to make an isosurface
$f(x, y, z) = 0$ where $f$ is arbitrary with **CGAL** but I don't know
an efficient way to pass a function from R to C++. Here is the Barth
decic obtained with this function:

The algorithm used by **CGAL** is not the marching cubes algorithm.
Actually, so far, I didn't observe any advantage of this algorithm as
compared to the marching cubes algorithm (if you know such an advantage,
please leave an [answer
here](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/42410/14840)).

There is now the `convexHull()` function in the package, and also
`convexHullsIntersection` to (fastly) compute a mesh of the intersection
of some convex hulls. I used it to get the intersection of the [compound
of five
tetrahedra](https://laustep.github.io/stlahblog/posts/tetrahedraCompound.html):

The `sphericalTriangle()` function allows to get a mesh of a spherical
triangle. Here is a spherical icosahedron:

Hopefully the package will pass the CRAN checks.
