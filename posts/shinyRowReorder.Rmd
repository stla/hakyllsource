The 'RowReorder' extension of **datatables** is available in the **DT** package. 
This extension allows to reorder the rows of a **DT** table by dragging and 
dropping. However, if you enable this extension in a Shiny app for a table 
using the server-side processing (option `server=TRUE` in `renderDT`), that 
won't work: each time the rows are reordered, they will jump back to their 
original locations.

So, if you want to use the server-side processing, you have to get the new order 
of the rows whenever they are reordered and then you have to replace the 
data by applying this new order to it. It is possible to get the new order in 
JavaScript by listening to the **datatables** event `row-reorder`. Then it 
suffices to send this new order to the Shiny server with the help of 
`Shiny.setInputValue`. Here is the JavaScript code which does this job, 
where `n` is the number of rows of the data:

```r
js <- c(
  "table.on('row-reorder', function(e, details, edit) {",
  sprintf("  var order = [%s];", toString(0:(n-1))),
  "  for(entry of details) {",
  "    order[entry.newPosition] = entry.oldPosition;",
  "  }",
  "  Shiny.setInputValue('newOrder', order);",
  "});"
)
```

With this code, whenever the rows are reordered, the Shiny server receives 
the new order in `input$newOrder`. So one can use a Shiny observer of this 
value, in which we can replace the data with the help of the **DT** function 
`replaceData`. One has to keep track of the transformed data for the subsequent
reorderings, and we can use a reactive dataframe to do so. Here is the full code
of the implementation of this method in a Shiny app:

```r
library(shiny)
library(DT)

dat <- data.frame(
  Type  = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
  Value = c(100, 90, 80, 70)
)

js <- c(
  "table.on('row-reorder', function(e, details, edit) {",
  sprintf("  var order = [%s];", toString(0:(nrow(dat)-1))),
  "  for(entry of details) {",
  "    order[entry.newPosition] = entry.oldPosition;",
  "  }",
  "  Shiny.setInputValue('newOrder', order);",
  "});"
)

showRowNames <- TRUE

ui <- fluidPage(
  br(),
  DTOutput("table")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  
  output$table <- renderDT({
    datatable(
      dat,
      rownames = showRowNames,
      extensions = "RowReorder",
      callback = JS(js),
      options = list(rowReorder = TRUE)
    )
  }, server = TRUE)
  
  proxy <- dataTableProxy("table")
  
  Dat <- reactiveVal(dat)
  
  observeEvent(input$newOrder, {
    dat0 <- Dat()
    dat1 <- dat0[input$newOrder + 1, ]
    replaceData(proxy, dat1, resetPaging = FALSE, rownames = showRowNames)
    Dat(dat1)
  })
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
