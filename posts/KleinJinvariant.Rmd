Here are four representations of the 
[Klein j-invariant function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-invariant):

![](./figures/KleinFibo_5-6-7-9.png)

The Klein j-invariant function is a complex function defined on the upper 
half-plane of the complex numbers. On the above pictures, we mapped it to 
a circle with the inverse modified Cayley transformation, which is defined by 
$$
\Psi(z) = i + 2iz / (i - z)
$$
and which maps the unit circle to the upper half-plane. Then I use some 
[color maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring) to do these 
pictures. These color maps are available in the 
[**RcppColors**](https://github.com/stla/RcppColors) package. 

I particularly like the first picture and I did an animation of it. The 
purpose of this blog post is to explain how I did.

The animation is made with the help of a modular Möbius transformation
$$
R(z) = - \frac{1}{z+1}
$$
and its generalized powers
$$
R^t(z) = 
\frac{\Bigl(\sqrt{3}\cos\bigl(\frac{\pi t}{3}\bigr) 
- \sin\bigl(\frac{\pi t}{3}\bigr)\Bigr) z - 2\sin\bigl(\frac{\pi t}{3}\bigr)}
{2\sin\bigl(\frac{\pi t}{3}\bigr) z + \sqrt{3}\cos\bigl(\frac{\pi t}{3}\bigr) 
+ \sin\bigl(\frac{\pi t}{3}\bigr)}
$$
This transformation is of order three, i.e.\ $R^3(z)=z$. I found it in 
[this paper](https://www3.risc.jku.at/publications/download/risc_5011/DiplomaThesisPonweiser.pdf).

Let's define it in R: 
```r
R <- function(z, t) {
  a <- pi*t/3
  ((sqrt(3)*cos(a) - sin(a)) * z - 2*sin(a))/
    (2*sin(a) * z + sqrt(3)*cos(a) + sin(a))
}
```
as well as the inverse modified Cayley transformation (also found in the above 
paper):
```r
Psi <- function(z) {
  1i + (2i*z) / (1i - z)
}
```
This function $\Psi$ is the one we will use to represent the Klein j-invariant 
function on a circle.

Now, I made a grid of the unit circle. Well, not really. The Klein j-invariant 
function is available in the **jacobi** package under the name `kleinj`. 
But when a complex number `tau` in the upper half-plane (i.e. with positive 
imaginary part) is too close to the real line, the `kleinj` function fails. 
The inverse modified Cayley transform $\Psi$ maps the boundary of the unit 
circle to the real line. 
So I take the centered circle of radius $0.96$ instead of the unit circle. 
I apply $\Psi$ to each point $z$ in this circle, and I return $\Psi(z)$ or 
$-1/\Psi(z)$. Later I will apply $j$ (the Klein j-invariant function) to the 
results. The reason for which I return $-1/\Psi(z)$ sometimes (when $\Im(z)<0$) 
is that $j(\tau) = j(-1/\tau)$ and I found that applying this transformation 
avoids some failures of `kleinj`. 

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(jacobi)
f <- function(x, y) {
  z <- complex(real = x, imaginary = y)
  w <- Psi(z)
  ifelse(
    Mod(z) > 0.96, 
    NA_complex_,
    ifelse(
      y < 0, -1/w, w
    )
  )
}
x <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = 2048L)
y <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = 2048L)
Z <- outer(x, y, f)
K <- kleinj(Z) / 1728
```

In fact, there are two Klein j-invariant functions, differing by a factor of 
$1728$. That's why I divide by $1728$: I take the other Klein function.

We're almost ready. But there's an issue and we will have to overcome it. 
Let's load the **RcppColors** package, and we will use the `colorMap5` color 
map. Observe the "first" picture, the one obtained without applying $R^t$:

```r
image <- colorMap5(K), bkgcolor = "white")
svg("x.svg")
opar <- par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(
  c(-1, 1), c(-1, 1), type = "n", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", 
  xlab = NA, ylab = NA, axes = FALSE, asp = 1
)
rasterImage(image, -1, -1, 1, 1)
par(opar)
dev.off()
rsvg::rsvg_png(
  "x.svg", "Klein_t0.png", width = 512, height = 512
)
```

![](./figures/Klein_t0.png)

And now, observe the picture obtained by applying $R^{0.01}$;

```r
image <- colorMap5(R(K, 0.01), bkgcolor = "white")
svg("x.svg")
opar <- par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(
  c(-1, 1), c(-1, 1), type = "n", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", 
  xlab = NA, ylab = NA, axes = FALSE, asp = 1
)
rasterImage(image, -1, -1, 1, 1)
par(opar)
dev.off()
rsvg::rsvg_png(
  "x.svg", "Klein_t001.png", width = 512, height = 512
)
```

![](./figures/Klein_t001.png)

There's a "jump": the transition from the first picture to the second one is 
too fast. So, since we want to make the pictures with $t$ running from $0$ to 
$3$, we need to slow down the transition when there's such a jump. We will use 
a "smooth staircase function" for that. A nice one is $x - \sin(x)$:

```{r xminsinx, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', out.width=512}
xmsinx <- function(x) x - sin(x)
curve(xmsinx, from = -2*pi, to = 2*pi, lwd = 2)
```

I firstly tried to use this function but this is not enough: the transitions 
are still too fast. We can iterate this function to get more slowness:

```{r xminsinxitr, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', out.width=512}
curve(xmsinx(xmsinx(x)), from = -2*pi, to = 2*pi, lwd = 2)
```

This one is good. We need to modify it in order that the "stairs" fit the 
"jumps". We will range $t$ from $-2\pi$ to $\pi$ and we will apply the modified 
smooth stair case function $s$ defined by 
```r
s <- function(x) {
  (xmsinx(xmsinx(2*x)) + 4*pi) / (2*pi)  
}
```
Applied to $t$ will give a range from $0$ to $3$.

We're ready! Let's make the animation frames:

```r
t_ <- seq(-2*pi, pi, length.out= 91L)[-1L]
for(i in seq_along(t_)) {
  KRt <- R(K, s(t_[i]))
  image <- colorMap5(KRt, bkgcolor = bkgcol)
  svg("x.svg")
  opar <- par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
  plot(
    c(-1, 1), c(-1, 1), type = "n", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", 
    xlab = NA, ylab = NA, axes = FALSE, asp = 1
  )
  rasterImage(image, -1, -1, 1, 1)
  par(opar)
  dev.off()
  rsvg::rsvg_png(
    "x.svg", sprintf("frame%03d.png", i), width = 512, height = 512
  )
}
```

The frames are done. It remains to mount them to a GIF with **gifski**. 

```r
library(gifski)
pngFrames <- Sys.glob("frame*.png")
gifski(
  pngFrames,
  "Kleinj.gif",
  width = 512, height = 512,
  delay = 1/10
)
file.remove(pngFrames)
```
